# Brand Assets

To add or update Brand Assets to the site, you will need to create and/or edit an asset directory page. This allows the site to render the given page with the correct images, layout, and information.

## Adding New Assets

There are two types of additions in regards to adding new brand assets - 1. adding an asset to an existing page and 2. adding new assets with a new page.

### New asset to existing page

### New asset with new page

## Updating Brand Assets

When updating a brand asset, you can either replace the asset with the same name/image type (thus only needing to replace the file and not update anything else), or you can replace the asset and update the page.

### Replace asset with same name/extension

### Replace asset entirely
  - this requires the rendering page to be updated as well
